TESTING CREDENTIALS:

This app is intentionally read-only. Users cannot create, edit, or delete schedules or providers. This is by design as it's meant for viewing on-call information, not managing it.

NETWORK REQUIREMENT:
The app requires internet connectivity to fetch data from the Supabase backend in real-time. There is currently no offline mode.

PRIVACY:
- No personal health information (PHI) is displayed beyond provider contact information
- No patient data is transmitted or stored
